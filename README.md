## Beyond Remote Desktop
A web-based architecture designed for simultaneous, real-time viewing and control of multiple remote computers over the internet.<hr>


### Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- FastAPI
- WebSockets
- PyAutoGUI
- Docker

### Future Scope
- Explore alternative protocols like WebRTC for potentially more efficient peer-to-peer screen streaming.
- Session Recording
- UI/UX Improvements
- RBAC - Role Based Access Control

#### Working/Proceeding-:
- Download the code on the system you wish to operate (These systems will be the host/hosts)
- Using a python interpreter/Pycharm/IDE run the host.py
- When the host starts running connection is created and now using any other device(This system will be called client) log on to [BeRD](https://berd.yashanksingh.in/hosts)
- Use credentials 
  <br> Username: amuhacks
  <br> Password: supersecret
- Find the new device(the one on which python instance is running)(host) logged in, it will show named as '...'
- Now you can use this device(client) to control the other device(host).
<hr>

_This creates a remote desktop connection, you can see what is happening on the screen and can utilise pre defined commands for transfer of data and seamless control._
<br>
_Running the python instances on multiple devices will create multiple hosts, all with different UUID, you can control these multiple devices by forming group. See on the left side of the panel._
<hr>

- Now you can acces multiple computer systems at once using control panel in groups section (bottom right area).
- Using control panel will open a different layout and now here the list of device will be shown with details such as their creation time and name.
- Here you can navigate to all systems(hosts) in a grid view or a table view as you wish. You can use commands within the control panel and the command will be followed on each and every host present in the group. (For example try run command and type notepad and submit.) 
- The notepad will run on all systems(hosts) added in the group, all at once,the program is successful in case of any issue feel free to contact our team.
